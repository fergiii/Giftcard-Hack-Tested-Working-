# Giftcard-Hack-Tested-Working-
Working as of October 20th 2023. Small improvements keep being made to the script USE OLDER METHODS AT YOUR OWN RISK, this method is the original method, do not download copies from other people

How does it work?
It's simple. We will use a Tampermonkey script that changes the timezone of our
browser whenever we make a new order on G2A. As soon as we are redirected
to the payment page, our timezone will change, which will result in our order
being marked as "Expired" on G2A's payment processor - Bitbay. However, the
order will not be marked as expired on G2A's side. If we pay for the products,
the order will be successfully processed and delivered by G2A, but the money
Here is a summary of the process:
1. Install the Google Chrome extension Tampermonkey.
2. Install a script that changes your browser's timezone after making an order on G2A.
3. Create a new order on G2A and pay for the products with Bitcoin.
4. Claim your products (the order will be successfully processed by G2A).
5. Wait a few minutes for a refund from Bitbay (Bitbay is a Bitcoin payment processor for G2A. They will
refund your money because the order is marked as "Expired" on their side due to the timezone
conflict).
